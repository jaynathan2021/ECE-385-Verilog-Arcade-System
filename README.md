This project is a hardware recreation of the classic arcade game Astro Fighter, designed and implemented using Verilog in Altera Quartus and deployed on an FPGA platform with a NIOS II processor. The game features keyboard controlled spaceship movement, real time VGA graphics, and dynamic enemy waves. Custom SystemVerilog modules handle player/enemy logic, missile mechanics, collision detection, health and score tracking, and state transitions. The design was built using Platform Designer to integrate key components such as SDRAM, SPI, USB controllers, and VGA output. This project demonstrates a full embedded system workflow, from low-level hardware design to game logic.
